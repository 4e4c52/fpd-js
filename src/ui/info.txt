Architecture

I want to follow a mvc architecture so it will be easy to customise/overwrite the web components. 

Folder Structure
-view: Web Components
-controller: Connect the view components with the FPD API


Todos
- breakpoints: {small, medium, large} Define the pixels for the breakpoints when the UI changes to the device layout.
