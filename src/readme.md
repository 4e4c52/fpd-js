### Architecture

I want to follow a mvc architecture so it will be easy to customise/overwrite the web components. 

#### Folder Structure
-view: Web Components
-controller: Connect the view components with the FPD API
-classes: The FancyProductDesigner classes which will interact with the controllers
-vendor: All third-party assets


### Todos
- breakpoints: {small, medium, large} Define the pixels for the breakpoints when the UI changes to the device layout.
