		    <h3>Setup Guide</h3>
		    <p>After you unzip the archive, you'll find the necessary JS files in the js folder. Just include the minified version in the page in which you are already running the Fancy Product Designer.</p><pre style="background: #efefef; padding: 10px;">&lt;script src="js/FPDPricingRules.min.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>

			<p>To generate the pricing rules for your product designer, we offer a handy online tool that will create the JS code that you can easily copy &amp; paste into your website. Just go to <a href="http://fancyproductdesigner.com/addon-pricing-rules/" rel="noreferrer">http://fancyproductdesigner.com/addon-pricing-rules/</a> and scroll down to "Create Pricing Rules".</p>

			<p>Here you can define own pricing groups and in every pricing group you can set the pricing rules for various element properties. When you are done, click on the "GET JS CODE" button and copy the <em>pricingRules</em> property that you need to merge with the other plugin options that you are using for the FancyProductDesigner class (<a href="http://support.fancyproductdesigner.com/support/solutions/articles/5000581438-quick-setup-for-jquery" target="_blank">See <em>Call the plugin</em> section</a>).</p>
